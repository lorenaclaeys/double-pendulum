#double_pendulum

We have immplemented a python code to analyse the single and double double pendulum.

What does the code contain?
The code is made up of have 4 files : solver, graph, lyapunov, main.
- "solver" contains our integration method: Runge kutta 4.
- "graph" contains an animation function for the single double pendulum and an other animation function for the 2 double pendulums.
- "lyapunov" contains a function and a graph for the energy of the 2 double pendulum, a function to find the maximum lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the lyapunov exponent and finally a function that shows us the evolution of the maximal lyapunov exponent in function of the energy.
- "main" contains the results of everything we have immplemented, as well as the graphics.

How to use the code?
Choose your initial conditions and your parameters in "main" and then run "main".
